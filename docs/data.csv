"","Organisation specific notes on status: In late June 2021 around 7,000 employees from Community Rehabilitation Companies were transferred in from the private sector to HM Prison and Probation Service, counting as entrants. The Defence Electronics and Components Agency does not record the date in which their employees first enter the Civil Service and so entrants data is not available. HM Land Registry do not record where their departing employees transfer to and so are unable to identify those that transfer to another Civil Service department.","","","",""
